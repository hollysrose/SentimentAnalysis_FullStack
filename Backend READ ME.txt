There are four classes: Neuron, Synapses, NeuralNetwork, and WordVectorizer.

It is recommended to read either the Neuron or Synapses class first,
and then to read the other.
After both Neuron and Synapses have been read, NeuralNetwork will make sense
as the NeuralNetwork is simply made of Neurons and Synapses.

DO NOT reading the WordVectorizer first.
The WordVectorizer does make input for the NeuralNetwork, but
the WordVectorizer is likely to be less interesting and a poor entrance point.
